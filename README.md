# Badunk_v1

This is my event manager app in progress. Currently, it is in its first version, where it's just the base of an event manager app. Over time, I will be adding more features to the application.

## Features to be Added in the Future
* Manager/Admin and Employee/Student roles to coordinate objectives in a team
* A unique point system to incentivize completing objectives posted
* An active timer on tasks
* A more appealing UI that is fun for users to interact with
* And much more!
